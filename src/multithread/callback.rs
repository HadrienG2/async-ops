//! Callback-based asynchronous operation monitoring
//!
//! This module provides a way to monitor asynchronous operations through
//! asynchronous callbacks. It is more flexible than polling and blocking (which
//! could technically be implemented on top of it), and can achieve higher
//! performance, but at the cost of somewhat higher code complexity.

// TODO: Implement async operation monitoring based on callbacks & executors
